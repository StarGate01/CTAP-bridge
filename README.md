# FIDO2 PC/SC CTAPHID Bridge

This project provides a translation bridge for NFCCTAP authenticators connected via PC/SC to a virtual USB device using CTAPHID. This enables software which only implements support for USB CTAPHID (e.g. Firefox and Chrome on Linux) to use NFC FIDO2 tokens via PC/SC as well. Fragmentation can be set using the `-f` switch.

This project has been forked from the *Virtual WebAuthn Authenticator* project at https://github.com/UoS-SCCS/VirtualWebAuthn , which provides a fully virtualized authenticator. This implementation has been removed and replaced by the bridging code, only the HID and CTAP layers are still used. For more information and documentation on CTAP2, see that repository, this fork has been stripped down to the bare minimum.

## Setup

Linux is required, or any other POSIX system which supports configFS, USB gadgets, and pyUSB via libusb. The script also requires root permissions. It is recommended to run it as a e.g. systemd service.

If your system has a host USB OTG emulation chip, you can load that module instead of the dummy driver to proxy the connection to a physical interface. For instruction on how to set up a hardware proxy using a Raspberry Pi Zero W 1 and a MAX3421E USB Host chip, see my blog post: https://chrz.de/2023/11/07/fido2-protocol-translation-hardware/ . 

For notifications, `notify-send` is used, so make sure it is installed and a suitable backend exists if you want to be notified.

### Kernel

Ensure that the modules `dummy_hcd` (or some other usb driver which supports device mode) and `libcomposite` are loaded. The directory `/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget` should be available.

The Linux kernel has to built with these configuration option to enable USB gadget, the USB host emulator, and config FS support. This is usually the case if you use a standard kernel.

```
USB y
USB_GADGET y
USB_CONFIGFS y
USB_CONFIGFS_F_FS y
```

### USB config

The scripts in `scripts/` use config FS to setup the USB Gadget. 

The USB ID `1209:000C` is a testing code with belongs to https://pid.codes/. Make sure to then adjust the udev rules as well if you decide to change it.

You can also change the manufacturer name, product name, and serial number if you want to.
### Udev config

Udev has to be configures to allow access to the emulated USB device as well. This will also setup a symlink `/dev/ctaphid` to the emulated USB device, which is used by the scripts.

Find the required udev rules in `scripts/udev.rules`. If your distribution uses `plugdev`, add `,  GROUP="plugdev"` to both lines.

### CCID Proxying

If you want to use some other userspace service to also expose a CCID interface on the emulated USB gadget, you can tell the script to set up a composite USB device using the `-c` flag. This requires you to compile and install the `f_ccid` kernel module. This module is not available in mainline Linux, instead you have to apply the patch from https://lkml.org/lkml/diff/2018/5/26/178/1 to your kernel source, and enable the `USB_F_CCID y` option.
